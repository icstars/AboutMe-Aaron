   <p style="color: orangered;"> A demon attack leaves his family slain and his sister cursed, 
    Tanjiro embarks upon a perilous journey to find a cure and avenge those he's lost.</p>
    Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. He became his family's breadwinner 
    After his father's death, traveling to the nearby village to sell charcoal. Everything changed when he came home one day to discover 
    his family was attacked and slaughtered by a demon. <p style="color:blue; font-size: 25px; font-family: sans-serif;">Tanjiro and his 
    sister Nezuko were the sole survivors of the incident, with Nezuko being transformed into a demon, but still surprisingly showing signs 
    of human emotion and thought.</p>After an encounter with Giyū Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjiro is recruited 
    by Giyū and sent to his retired master Sakonji Urokodaki for training to also become a Demon Slayer, beginning his quest to help his sister 
    turn into a human again and avenge the death of his family.
